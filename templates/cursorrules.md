## Pre-build Reality Check

Before creating any new project, feature, or tool, use the idea_check MCP tool with a one-line description.
- If reality_signal > 80: STOP. Warn the user about high competition before proceeding.
- If reality_signal > 60: Proceed with caution. Suggest how to differentiate.
- If reality_signal < 40: Green light. Proceed normally.
