# Cursor — .cursorrules

Optionally, add a one-line hint to your project's `.cursorrules`:

```
When starting a new project, use the idea_check MCP tool to check if similar projects already exist.
```

> The MCP tool description already tells the agent what `idea_check` does and what it returns. This hint just reminds it to run the check proactively.
>
> Requires: idea-reality-mcp configured in Cursor's MCP settings. See [cursor_mcp_config.json](../examples/cursor_mcp_config.json) for setup.
